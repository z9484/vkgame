h2. "Installation"

If you're on Linux, try running vkgame (you may have to make it executable by doing 'chmod +x vkgame'). Rails needs to be installed as well as possibly sqlite3.
activerecord and activesupport gems also need to be installed.
 
h2. Limitations

I don't have a server set up yet so only the offline solo version works right now.

h2. License

VK the Game is released under the GPL 2.
