h2. "Installation"

If you're on Linux, try running vkgame (you may have to make it executable by doing 'chmod +x vkgame'). If that doesn't work try running shoes2.run and selecting vkgame.rb. And if that doesn't work or you're on another platform, try "downloading Shoes":http://shoooes.net for your platform and feeding it vkgame.rb. Good luck.

h2. Limitations

I don't have a server set up yet so only the offline solo version works right now.
